# My First Deno Blog Post

After years of tinkering with HTML, CSS, JS, and a few back-end technologies, I’ve finally jumped into the **Deno ecosystem** — and wow, what a smooth start.

I had been eyeing Deno for a while, mostly curious about its modern take on Node.js. No `node_modules`, secure by default, TypeScript first — all things that aligned with how I like to build. But the real kicker? **Deno Deploy** and the Lume static site generator.

## Why Deno?

I was drawn in by:

- Zero-config serverless deployment via [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)
- First-class support for TypeScript and modern ES modules
- A rich standard library — no need to `npm install` for basics
- Clean integration with GitHub

## Why Lume?

I wanted a site that:

- Was blazing fast
- Let me write posts in Markdown
- Could be deployed with a single push to GitHub

Lume checked all those boxes. Inspired by sites like [tinyclouds.org](https://tinyclouds.org), I forked a setup that used `.page.ts` files, `search.pages()`, and layouts powered by `.tsx`.

## Bash + Deno = ⚡

I’m also embracing more **Bash scripting** to automate tasks:

- Deploying to Deno with CLI
- Converting images or logs with `deno run`
- Crons for syncing repos or content (shoutout [Deno Cron Jobs](https://dash.deno.com/tutorial/tutorial-cron))

## What's Next?

This blog is just the start. I plan to:

- Build utilities that pull and visualize data using Deno scripts
- Explore Lume plugins and themes
- Share code snippets, small tools, and creative experiments right here

**Thanks for reading — and welcome to my Deno-powered corner of the web.**
